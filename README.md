## About

This project is a React and TypeScript implementation of a web application called CreatExam. The application enables users to generate multiple-choice questionnaires (MCQs) on specific topics using the GPT-4 API by OpenAI. CreatExam features a sleek and intuitive user interface, offering functionality to input topics, dynamically create question sets, and review or export the generated quizzes to platforms such as Moodle. The aplication is designed to simplify the process of creating educational materials and assessments.

This project was undertaken as a personal endeavor to deepen my expertise in front-end development with React and TypeScript while exploring the integration of AI-driven APIs. The development process provided hands-on experience in modern web development practices, API management, and UI/UX design.
